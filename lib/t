I'll explain the entire architecture and data flow in a way that's easy to understand, without code - just pure knowledge!
@### 1. Understanding the Folder Structure First
```
lib/
├── //$core/           (Think of this as your toolbox)
├── //$data/           (Think of this as your data management center)
├── //$presentation/   (Think of this as what users see and interact with)
└── //$routes/         (Think of this as your navigation map)
```

Let's break down each part:
!### 2. Core (Your Toolbox) 🧰
- **constants/**
  - Like a drawer where you keep all your fixed values
  - Colors (like your brand colors)
  - Text styles (how your text should look)
  - Image paths (where your images are stored)

- **utils/**
  - Helper tools you'll use throughout the app
  - Like having a Swiss Army knife of useful functions

- **services/**
  - Think of these as your app's support staff:
  - **api/** - Your messenger who talks to the internet
    - Handles how your app communicates with servers
    - Makes sure requests are properly formatted
    - Deals with internet problems
  
  - **app/** - Your app's control center
    - Manages dark/light mode
    - Handles language changes
    - Checks internet connection

  - **errors/** - Your error management team
    - Catches problems
    - Explains what went wrong
    - Helps handle errors gracefully

!### 3. Data (Your Information Management) 📊
- **models/**
  - These are like forms or templates
  - Example: A User model is like a form with fields:
    - Name
    - Email
    - Profile picture
  - When data comes from the server, it gets organized into these templates

- **repositories/**
  - Think of these as specialized workers
  - Each repository has one job:
    - UserRepository handles user-related tasks
    - PropertyRepository handles property-related tasks
  - They know how to:
    - Get data from the internet
    - Save data locally
    - Update data

!### 4. Presentation (What Users See) 👀
Each feature (like auth, home, profile) has:
- **views/**
  - The actual screens users see
  - Like pages in a book

- **bloc/**
  - The brain behind each feature
  - Works like this:
    1. User does something (taps a button)
    2. BLoC receives this action
    3. BLoC decides what to do
    4. BLoC updates the screen

- **widgets/**
  - Reusable pieces of the interface
  - Like building blocks you can use again and again

!### 5. Data Flow (How Everything Works Together) 🔄

1. **User Interaction Flow:**
   ```
   User taps button → BLoC receives action → Repository gets/updates data → Screen updates
   ```

2. **Data Loading Flow:**
   ```
   App starts → Repository checks local storage → If needed, calls API → Updates models → Updates screen
   ```

3. **Error Handling Flow:**
   ```
   Problem occurs → Error service catches it → Shows user-friendly message → Handles recovery
   ```

!### 6. Implementation Order (Where to Start) 📝

1. Start with Core setup
   - Set up basic colors and styles
   - Set up API communication basics

2. Create basic models
   - Start with user model
   - Add other models as needed

3. Create repositories
   - Start with authentication
   - Add feature-specific repositories

4. Build features one by one
   - Start with login/signup
   - Then main features
   - Finally, additional features

!### 7. Best Practices 🌟

1. **Keep It Organized**
   - Each feature in its own folder
   - Related code stays together

2. **Think Modular**
   - Build features that can work independently
   - Easy to add or remove features

3. **Plan for Change**
   - Make it easy to change APIs
   - Make it easy to change the UI

2. How repositories handle data
3. How BLoC manages state
